## Experiment: V17 (Split LayerNorm + Block Diagonal [No Cross])
**Date:** 2025-12-14
**Goal:** Achieve Plasticity (Learning Skill B) while preserving Identity (Skill A) using pure block-diagonal expansion (isolated cross-terms) and "Open Gate" initialization.

**Hypothesis:** 
1. `router_init_bias=0.0` (Open Gate) will allow immediate gradient flow.
2. `isolate_cross_terms=True` will perfect identity preservation (no interference from Old->New or New->Old).
3. `SplitLayerNorm` prevents normalization competition.

**Results:**
- **Skill A Retention:** Excellent (Loss ~1.3). Identity preserved.
- **Skill B Acquisition:** **FAILED** (Loss ~18.5, Random Chance).
- **Gradients:** `Active_Grad_Norm` ~ 6e-5 (Tiny). `Gate_Grad_Norm` ~ 0.2 (Healthy). `Frozen_Grad_Norm` ~ 0.0.

**Analysis (The "Dead Sidecar" Effect):**
The combination of `isolate_cross_terms=True` and weak initialization (1e-3) creates a signal vacuum.
1. **Isolation:** The New Parameter Subsystem (Sidecar) cannot "read" features from the Pre-Trained Core (Old). It only sees "New" inputs.
2. **Daisy-Chaining:** The "New" inputs at Layer N come from the "New" outputs of Layer N-1.
3. **Attenuation:** Since New Weights are initialized to ~1e-3 (to preserve identity), the signal decays by 10^-3 at *every layer*.
4. **Result:** By the time the signal reaches the LM Head, it is essentially zero (1e-9). Gradients backpropagating also decay by the same factor. The new network is "Dark".

**Conclusion:**
Strict Block-Diagonalization (`isolate_cross_terms=True`) is **incompatible** with Deep Expansion unless the new path has:
A) Strong Initialization (Breaks Identity), OR
B) Access to Strong Features (Cross-Terms).

**Action Plan:**
Unlock Cross-Terms (`Old->New`). Allow the sidecar to bootstrap off the core's features.
